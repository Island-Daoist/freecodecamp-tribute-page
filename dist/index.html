      <h3>The myths and events surrounding Lao Tzu (Laozi)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thought to have Lived During</strong> anywhere from the 6th century to 4th century BC he remains a figure of intrigue to many and a strong presence in modern Taoism. Whether the man as is told by stories ever existed may never be known, but there can be no denial that the figure of this man has persisted through centuries. No matter your belief the words attributed to him have reached millions. Even if you are unaware of it you have likely heard some of his wisdom in the past.</li>
        <li><strong>His Many Names</strong> come from the numerous and varying stories of his origin and who he was. Lao Tzu itself is an honorific title that translates as 'Old Master'. In many traditional tellings he is a man by the name of Li Er. But was also to be known as a companion of Confucius so could also have the name Lao Dan. Though his history is an area of uncertainty the figure we know as Lao Tzu has had a deep and lasting impact on philosophy the world over for centuries.</li>
        <li><strong>The Stories</strong> tell many things of this man. His history may never be settled, but the common stories tell of Lao Tzu having once been a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou. The stories reveal that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples with his teachings. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the Zhuangzi. The stories continue in saying Lao Tzu grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80.</li>
        <li><strong>The legend of the Tao Te Ching</strong> tell that at the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Lao Tzu wrote was said to be the Tao Te Ching, although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Lao Tzu, never to be seen again. In others, the "Old Master" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha. Others say he was the Buddha himself.</li>
        <li><strong>The meaning to Taoists</strong> for his existance is deep and profound. Lao Tzu is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism, intimately connected with the Tao Te Ching and "primordial" (or "original") Taoism. Popular ("religious") Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the official head deity. Intellectual ("elite") Taoists, such as the Celestial Masters sect, usually present Lao Tzu (Laojun, "Lord Lao") and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities.</li>
        <li><strong>The impact of his teachings</strong> can be felt the world over. Because of it's long history and formative impact on the development of Taoism all modern Taoists can trace back their practice to his teachings. The long history of Taoism has also had a profound impact on the world, with many people in other parts of the world taking up his words and living by them. Historically his teachings have changed the way that rulers of China's dynasties have governed their empires. With clear and direct teachings on how anyone should govern a people and the strong presence of Taoism amongst the royalty this led to very differing periods of time in Chinese history.</li>
        <li><strong>Whether a real man or a myth</strong> his long lasting legacy and impact on the world cannot be denied. His name will be one that continues to be spoken for generations more. Because whether he was once a man or not is not what is important, but rather what the idea of this man means and the teachings spread in his name. What is important is not his identity even, but that just his image alone can move people. Because regardless of what you believe of his past, he exists within the minds of millions not as a man but as an ideal. The point where all want to be someday, existing in complete peace. Much like the ideology of the Buddha, the legend of Lao Tzu will surely continue to leave it's mark upon the world.</li>

    The Tao Te Ching, Chapter 1:<br>
    <i>"The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao<br>
        The name that can be named is not the eternal name<br>
        The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth<br>
        The named is the mother of myriad things<br>
        Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence<br>
        Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations<br>
        These two emerge together but differ in name<br>
        The unity is said to be the mystery<br>
        Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders
